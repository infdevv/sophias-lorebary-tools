~~THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A FIXED VERSION ON THE WAY~~

~~USER SECURITY IS SAVED 🗣🗣🗣🗣~~

update on nov 17th, half the tools still work. don't use lorebary, use an alternative. if you need, heres one: https://mercy.cosmoschat.xyz or whatever else you can find. just don't use fucking lorebary. **THEY DO NOT CARE FOR YOUR SECURITY** there were critical vulnurabilites, and their first idea was to wait until **V2 TO DO THE FIXES**, that means they knew about the vulnurabilites but instead of patching them immediately, they want your shit to be unsecure until V2. Sophia herself in her statement about a potential cease and desist over this repo even acknowledged that the infomation from these vulns **could be used to doxx people**. these are not some hackerman level vulnurabilites, these are vulnurabilites that a few lines of code could fix. she's too lazy to do that. hell i can rant about this more, but i don't wanna include that much supposedly "private" things here.

## lorebary is a vibecoded slop site. the claude coded UI is blatent. yall really let your security rely on claude? lmao

if you are sophia and you are reading this, fuck you, you know damn well why i'm still pissed, you are far more immature than i've ever been.
